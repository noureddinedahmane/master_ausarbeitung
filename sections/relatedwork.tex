\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:Related Work}

None of the existing approaches that deal with the automatic extraction of performance
model considers the parametric dependencies of performance models, the adaptive
monitoring and the incremental execution of the whole process at the same time. Moreover,
existing approaches do not support the adaptive monitoring for performance model continuous
integration.

Walter et al. \cite{walter2017expandable} provided an expandable approach for automated extraction of
architectural performance model. He presents a framework for the extraction of
the architectural performance models based on monitoring files generalizing over
the target architectural model language. This framework can be used to create
an extraction tool for a specific modeling formalism. He implemented his approach
in so called Performance Model Extractor (PMX) tool and provided it as a web service.

Krogmann et al. \cite{krogmann2012reconstruction, krogmann2010using} used genetic programming to estimate parametric dependencies between inputs and the number of execution for each byte code instruction.
Depending on input data he could find control flow dependencies between required
and provided services.

Spinner et al. \cite{spinner2016reference} predicted the system performance at run time under varying work
loads and system configuration. He proposed an approach for obtaining architectural-level model performance in virtualized environment.

Langhammer \cite{langhammer2017automated} introduced two approaches to extract the static and the dynamic
behavior of the source code. Furthermore, he proposed an approach that keeps the source code and the 
architecture consistent during development.
