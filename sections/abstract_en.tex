\Abstract
Model-driven performance prediction can be used in order to predict software performance at design stage. Applying it in agile development process can reduce time and effort spent on monitoring. However, building such model manually is impractical in agile development process because it tends to generate quick releases in shot cycles. Existing approaches that extract automatically Performance Model (PM) are based on reverse-engineering and/or measurement techniques. However, these approaches require to monitor and analyze the whole system after each iteration, which will cause a monitoring overhead. 

On the other hand, approaches that extract incrementally the PM from the source code and keep them consistent need a monitoring approach that provide them with the required monitoring information. Existing approaches either can not provide fine-grained monitoring information or the instrumentation of the source code has to be done manually which is unsuitable for developers.

To overcome these problems, this thesis introduces an approach that can monitor the system in an adaptive way and provide PMs with the fine-grained monitoring information. Moreover, our approach supports the continuous integration of PMs in agile development process. We achieved this by introducing an automatic adaptive instrumentation approach of the source code. Furthermore, our instrumentation approach can monitor changes in the source code during system development and instrument the source code automatically. During the system development we collect automatically the monitoring probes that are needed to instrument the source code. When changes in the source code are committed, we automatically instrument the source code based on the monitoring probes that we've generated during the system development. The benefit of our approach will be to reduce the high monitoring overhead and to support the continuous integration of performance models.  

In particular, our approach can be integrated with other approaches that keep the source code and the PM consistent (like the Coevolution approach of Langhammer). While these approaches tend to keep the source code and its behavior in terms of PM consistent, our approach will provide them with PM parameters (like Resource Demands RDs, loop execution number, the probability of selecting a branch).
